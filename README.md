# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis using Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee quality data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI).
The goal is to understand the factors that influence coffee quality using Power BI.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze key sensory attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, and Body
- Study the impact of processing methods and regions on coffee quality
- Analyze defects and their effect on overall coffee quality
- Understand how different variables affect Total Cup Points

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Microsoft Excel (for basic review)

## 📁 Dataset Information
- Source: Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)
- Includes sensory scores, processing methods, regions, and defects data
- Total Cup Points represent overall coffee quality

## 📈 Key Insights
- Flavor and Aroma have the highest average scores among sensory attributes
- Processing methods influence coffee quality scores
- Defects show no significant impact due to zero or low variation in the dataset
- Total Cup Points vary based on processing method and region

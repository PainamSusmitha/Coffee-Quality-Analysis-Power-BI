 Coffee Quality Analysis using Power BI

Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee quality data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI).
The goal is to understand the factors that influence coffee quality using Power BI.

 Objectives
- Analyze key sensory attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, and Body
- Study the impact of processing methods and regions on coffee quality
- Analyze defects and their effect on overall coffee quality
- Understand how different variables affect Total Cup Points

 Tools Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Microsoft Excel (for basic review)

 Dataset Information
- Source: Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)
- Includes sensory scores, processing methods, regions, and defects data
- Total Cup Points represent overall coffee quality

 Key Insights
- Flavor and Aroma have the highest average scores among sensory attributes
- Processing methods influence coffee quality scores
- Defects show no significant impact due to zero or low variation in the dataset
- Total Cup Points vary based on processing method and region
